Description
As an OLM Engineer,
I want to create a new Kafka topic,
So that I can make sure 100% of post-checkout orders are captured for audit & validation purposes.
Acceptance Criteria 1:
Given the system is processing checkout orders,
When an order is completed,
Then it should be published to the new Kafka topic with 12 partitions
Notes & Assumptions:
The Kafka topic must be scalable to handle the full volume of orders.
Integration with existing systems should be seamless.
A tool, means, or process should be developed to compare the data between Kafka and MQ.
The comparison mechanism identify or flag discrepancies for further investigation.
