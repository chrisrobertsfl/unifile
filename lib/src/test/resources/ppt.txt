The Kohl’s Way!
“…The insights around today’s consumer preferences have served as the basis of our new long-term 
strategic framework that will pave the path for a bigger, bolder, customer-centric future at Kohl's.”
“...As an organization, we have been fostering a more courageous culture to set the stage for the next era at 
Kohl's.”

Why Change?
● Spent too much money without company 
growth
● Didn’t always get the outcomes desired or 
expected
● Didn’t always work on the most valuable things
● Didn’t focus on the customer need
● Left unfinished work in our wake
● Didn’t allow flexibility to change direction
● Outputs mattered more than Outcomes
Customer-centric companies are all about their customers and make every decision 
and strategic move with customers in mind. In turn, customer-centric companies are 
60% more profitable than companies that aren’t.

What is a Project
●
A project is a temporary piece of work which falls 
outside 'business as usual' day-to-day operations and 
can be anything from moving offices or building a website 
to carrying out major construction work or complex 
statistical analysis. 
●
Some businesses are entirely project-based.  Sponsors 
find out something they think you need and get funding.

Working together to build better products
Designers, Product Managers and Engineers 
make up the balanced team but it doesn’t stop 
there. A balanced team is cross-functional 
and could be made up of many, diverse 
practitioners.
User
The key is allowing the users to drive our 
products’ direction.
This means connecting team members directly 
with users and empowering them to make 
decisions as close as possible to delivery.
These disciplines working together
“in balance”
23
We Work Differently
We Work Differently
Small teams that…
● are empowered with autonomy to make 
and act on product decisions 
● are highly collaborative and 
communicative
●
“sit” together
● are committed to a change in behavior, 
not a specific solution
● constantly test their ideas 
● have shortened feedback loops with 
customers
● ship features often 
● celebrate learning & failures
● embrace change with new information

25
Other Valuable Perspectives 
Product Management itself thrives on 
diversity. In product development, teams are 
strengthened by having a variety of 
backgrounds, perspectives and 
opinions in the room, as any product leader 
will tell you.
Having a diverse workforce has a knock-on 
positive effect on a company’s outputs. That’s 
especially true in the tech sector. Products 
are made for everyone, which means 
your products need to be built by 
everyone.
Different perspectives and backgrounds lead to 
different opportunities for us to solve with our 
technology

User-Centered Design (UCD) 
Practices
UCD is a product design philosophy that emphasises designing 
the product around the problems a user is having, 
rather than designing what the users say they want.
Design
We aim to design a solution that solves user and 
business problems. 
User Centered 
It prioritizes contact with end users, and not proxies, in order to

Why ask Why? (Examples)
These questions are asked not because there is a lack of trust in someone's effort or knowledge but to 
work to ensure we are understanding root problems.  Root problems identification opens the doors to 
many solution possibilities that may be better strategies than the one identified.

Extreme Programming (XP) & Balanced Team Values
XP is much more than just a development 
methodology, it is a set of values that inform 
whole team interaction.
Respect
Communication
“If members of a team don’t care about each other and 
“When problems arise in development, most 
what they are doing [and] don’t care about a project, 
often someone already knows the solution; but 
nothing can save it”
that knowledge doesn’t get through to someone 
with the power to make the change”
Simplicity
Feedback
“What is the simplest thing that could possibly 
“The sooner you know, the 
work?”
sooner you can adapt.”
Courage
“Courage is effective action 
in the face of fear”

We begin with outcomes
“...but what exactly is an outcome?” 
—Kohl’s team member
An outcome is a result. It’s 
the change that signals we are 
achieving business and user 
goals.
If you don’t know where you want to go, you 
probably won’t get there.

Why not start with a list of Features?

Difference Between Outcomes and Features
What is our outcome? How will we achieve the outcome?

Balanced Teams Liberating Constraints………
Outcome Factory > Feature 
Factory
“[In a] feature factory some forces outside of the 
team decides [what to work on] and the team just 
“does” [it].  That is not our model.  We are an 
outcome factory and the team continuously finds the 
path to great outcomes.”  - Paul Gaffney
Authority > Consensus
“I believe authority is earned rather than granted.  That 
said, every product team has complete decision rights 
on their work.  I repeat: every product team has 
complete decision rights on their work.
The product team via the product leader as their agent 
must actually decide what to work on.”  - Paul

A Word About our “Classroom” Setting
We are in a “classroom” setting, so many activities we do 
today will be artificially fast without the research that 
you would normally gather.
We will make bigger assumptions in these exercises 
than we would normally do but these are obvious 
examples of validated learning that we would need to do.

Journey Maps

Journey Maps...
● A journey map is one way of helping to define the value you can 
bring to a user through understanding the emotional 
engagement at each touchpoint of a user’s journey
● Emotional engagement is what brings people back to a product, 
even if it is functional
● It is especially important when your product is used at a time of 
need. A bad user experience just makes things worse
● From an existing journey, you can then design an ideal one
● Understanding a customer’s journey can help you define the value 
proposition for your product

82
What makes a good metric?
● Actionable: A good metric changes how we behave. This is the most important 
quality in a metric: it tells us what we should do differently based on the change 
we see (or not). It helps us make a decision.
● Accessible: A good metric is easy to understand and remember. If people don’t 
understand the metric, they won’t remember it or think about it which means they 
won’t take action on it. We should be able to easily get the data, and the feedback 
loop between taking action and seeing results should be short.
●
Auditable: The metric has to be credible to the people who drive the vision; 
everyone including sponsors and skeptics should be able to audit it. We should be 
scientific in our approach. i.e. you need good reason to believe that the effort 
influenced your defined metrics.

Example of Kohl’s Test Metrics / Results
Problem: Out of stocks are a growing issue for online orders
Hypothesis: if customers know inventory is low, they would accelerate placing an order (instead of just 
letting the item sit in their cart) and would be more understanding if an item did cancel.
Risks: some customers would see the badge and abandon if inventory was low
86

How do we measure user success?
Call out “user/customer” metrics for one of the 
problem statements below:

Leap of Faith Assumptions
So far we’ve defined a problem, a persona and a potential solution 
idea. But until tested, all the work is based on assumptions.
We will focus on identifying leap of faith assumptions. These are 
assumptions that, if we get them wrong, will jeopardize the success of 
our initiative.
As we begin to test our assumptions, these are the assumptions 
we should test first.

How do we Validate our Assumptions?
The Scientific Method
●
Make observations
● Formulate a hypothesis
● Design an experiment to test the 
hypothesis
● State the indicators to evaluate if the 
experiment has succeeded
● Conduct the experiment
● Evaluate the results of the experiment
● Accept or reject the hypothesis
● If necessary, make and test a new 
hypothesis

Experiment
Hypothesis Advertising is a driver of demand at Kohl’s. The inclusion of advertising events as 
signals in our demand prediction model will improve the accuracy of our 
predictions.
Evidence / Success measure
We will know this hypothesis is true if we see a decrease in 
the model error metric (WMAPE). WMAPE compares the 
percentage difference between actual demand and the 
model’s predicted demand, a lower value is better.
Test
To get that evidence we will measure the model’s WMAPE before and after the 
inclusion of advertising event signals and observe the difference. In our case, we 
saw a 0.5% decrease in the WMAPE, which was significant.

● Think about the leanest way to validate this assumption “To get 
that evidence, we will do/make...” (Test)
● Think about how you’d know whether you have validated or 
invalidated the assumption “We will know the assumption is true 
if…” (Success Measure)

Are The Outcomes Clearly Articulated
A well-articulated outcome describes the value that a team intends to create, for who and for which persona. A well-articulated 
outcome says more about the impact on the user and less about the details of the solution. It is also valuable to mention how you 
plan on achieving the outcome to give a sense of general direction the team plans to take.
For Saikiran Yerram, Senior Product Manager at Pivotal San Francisco, he “has consistently seen solution based roadmaps such 
as "Doing X will solve Y" instead of "Solving Y will achieve <some desired outcome>.” The best outcomes based roadmaps 
clearly show what will the user do more (or less) once the problem Y is solved.”  
When looking at your outcome be sure to ask yourself these questions:
●
Does it elucidate who the outcome is meant to help? Outcomes could be for customers, business or even your team.
●
What is the impact you hope to achieve?
●
Why is working on this outcome the most valuable thing you could be doing with your time? What are you deprioritizing to 
work on this? Listing the other outcomes that your team *could* work on but have decided not to is great way of showing 
what you factored into your prioritization decision. It also helps to break out your roadmap into short-term, mid-term, long-
term so you can lay out how you are prioritizing your work. As you are articulating outcomes for mid and long term think 
about what you are hoping to learn/validate instead of the thing you plan on building.
● Does it align with the priorities of your business?

How Good Are Your Metrics
Identifying metrics that tell you that you are making progress can be difficult. Often, it’s tempting to measure output and call 
it a day once it's shipped. However, a good metric tells you whether and by how much you were able to impact or add value 
for your persona. When looking at your metrics of success ask yourself these questions:
 
●
Do your metric(s) measure whether or not the outcome (not output) has been achieved? Beware of vanity/proxy 
metrics that appear correlative, but are not. Example: high acquisition numbers do not indicate that you are actually 
solving the problem for the user. Dan Jahner, Senior Product Manager at Pivotal San Francisco, “tests for whether a 
set of metrics are sufficient by trying to envision ways in which the metrics could be achieved without actually 
affecting the outcomes they intend to measure.”
●
Is the metric measureable? Take a moment to think about whether you can actually measure it and if it is easy to 
measure.
●
Do you have a baseline (or can you afford the time to get one) to be able to see progress? Prototyping, user 
interviews, current product instrumentation, and customer support tickets are all quick ways to achieve a baseline.
●
Are your metrics a mix of quantitative and qualitative? Quantitative metrics will only give you a signal of where to 
look. Qualitative metrics help you understand the signals and build the story.

Test 4:  Does Your Roadmap Represent an Aligned Viewpoint?
A roadmap at its core is a way of communicating priorities that are shared by the team and leadership or the team and 
customers/users. It is the cornerstone that can be used to make sure that everyone is on the same page on priorities and 
outcomes.
Building a roadmap that represents your point of view is easy. Building a roadmap that represents a viewpoint that is 
aligned with the team and leadership is much harder. So ask yourself:
● Was your team involved in building the roadmap? Would they be able to represent and speak to the roadmap as well 
as you?
●
Can you clearly connect the priorities outlined to one or more business objectives?
● Were your leaders/stakeholders involved as you were iterating on the roadmap?
Test 5: Is Your Roadmap Easy to Discover and Consume?
As mentioned earlier, a roadmap is a communication tool. It helps to communicate the shared priorities of the team 
externally to stakeholders like leadership, customers, users, marketing, sales, etc. The last thing you want to do is get on 
a call every time someone wants to understand what the team is working on. Ask yourself:
●
Is your roadmap easy to find? One easy trick is to link to it in your communications.
● What is the context people need to have to understand your roadmap? Provide references to material that helps 
with building context.
●
Who is your audience? You might need different framing and information for internal stakeholders vs external 
stakeholders.

Growth and Development Board 
“Tips”
● Growth Development Board discussions are highly facilitated 
sessions.
●
Meetings will start with a Facilitator defining the rules of the meeting 
and their role is to ensure the meeting stays on track and with the 
core GDB members only.
● Only Growth Development Board members actively engage
●
Extended team invitees are there for listening and information only
●
We want transparency and openness but also a productive 
conversation in a short amount of time.
● Discussions with this cross-functional team are focused on 
delivering business value.
●
Data will be used to make transparent pivot or persevere decisions 
about approaches to delivering value.
●
Products have been aligned to Company Strategies
● Cadence has been set to accomodate 2 products per session (Each Product discussion occurs 
every other month)
●
Purpose is to discuss contributions occurring and if the data is supporting outcomes to persevere 
or pivot.

How do we Validate our Assumptions?
The Scientific Method
●
Make observations
● Formulate a hypothesis
● Design an experiment to test the 
hypothesis
● State the indicators to evaluate if the 
experiment has succeeded
● Conduct the experiment
● Evaluate the results of the experiment
● Accept or reject the hypothesis
● If necessary, make and test a new 
hypothesis

PM Should have 3 touch points per week with the 
customers for at least 45 mins each time 
(interviews or getting feedback or demos)
PM Should spend first 15 mins of each day 
studying data/dashboards and understanding 
anomalies (breathing the data and know what is 
going on)

What is a user story?
A user story defines the who, what and why of the functionality being 
built.
It uses clear, unambiguous and non-technical language to 
communicate a value-adding outcome for a user.
Stories are an invitation for a conversation; they are not set in stone 
to dictate the work to be done.  They are living documents that serve 
the purpose of the team aligning on the reason behind working on 
something.

Should describe a 
vertical slice of 
implementation (or a 
whole slice of the 
cake of value) versus 
horizontal slice which 
doesn’t put value to 
the user (ie: a 
foundational layer is 
too big to take on as 
an epic).

How do we handle technical documentation OR 
more detailed documentation that a balanced 
team can refer to.
Talk about a story (user value) versus a “chore” (something technical engineers need to 
get done)
