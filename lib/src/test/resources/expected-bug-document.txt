*What happened?*

It appears that Order Details UI displays Putaway Started and Putaway Completed as "In fulfillment" for OLM orders.

*Given:*

To replicate the issue, follow these steps:
 # Get an order into putaway started or putaway completed status
 # Look at Order Details page on kohls.com (any environment where OLM Gateway is enabled for Order Details)
 # See how "In Fulfillment" is the status describing the status of the order

*Actual:*

The order status of Order Details for a Putaway Started/Completed status order is 'In Fulfillment"

*Expected:* 

We should send "Expired Pickup" as the status when mapping Putaway Started/Completed status for Order Details in the OLMToOMSOrderStatusDescriptionMapping class
