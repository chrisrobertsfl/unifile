- Jira Spike Detail
*As* an OLM engineer
*I want* to research why partially cancelled PAYPAL orders can't be returned
*Because we* need the amounts that are sent to KPP to be correct to work through return services (invoices loaded to the Return Service DB and numbers are correct)

This spike is ready for acceptance when:
 * We know the solution to return partially cancelled PAYPAL orders.Â 
 * We know the solution to return partially cancelled PAYPAL + KC orders
 * Create Jira to implement those
